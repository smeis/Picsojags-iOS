## Setup

To perform the necessary steps to compile this project, run the following command in the project root:

```
$ rake setup
```

Most importantly, it copies the services configration from ```Config/PhotoServices-sample.plist``` to ```Config/PhotoServices.plist```.

### Configuration

Add the API keys required for the services you intend to use to ```Config/PhotoServices-sample.plist```. The plist layout is as follows:

```
- root
|- Services: Dictionary 
  |- 500px: kjdfjhUYERHJ7435438
```

**Note:** I don't recommend storing your API keys in you app this way; they're easily accessed by looking through your app's resources. It's just a convenient way to hide keys from git commits in an open-source project, like this.

### Adding backends

Adding a backend is as easy as creating a new struct that conforms to `PhotoBackend`.

## Design

Images are created in Sketch. Icons and colors are generated by [PaintCode](https://www.paintcodeapp.com/). Check the source files in `Design/`.

## Documentation

Generate the documentation by calling:

```
$ rake docs

Or just press `âŒ˜ + U` in Xcode.
